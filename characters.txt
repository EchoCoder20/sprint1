Saif was a sharp-eyed boy of sixteen, with sun-darkened skin and a heart full of questions. Known in Al-Hamra for his daring climbs and endless curiosity, he often wandered beyond the village paths, chasing stories and secrets. Brave to a fault, Saif feared little—except a life without wonder.

Shadow, a lean desert wolf with ash-gray fur and eyes like burning embers, had followed Saif since he rescued her as a pup from a falaj ditch. Fiercely loyal and silent as moonlight, she moved like a shadow between rocks and dunes—Saif’s protector, guide, and the only soul he trusted completely.
