In the quiet mountain village of Al-Hamra, where terraced farms clung to the cliffs and frankincense trees whispered ancient secrets to the wind, young Saif uncovered a strange parchment buried beneath the worn stone floor of his late grandfather’s majlis. Faded with age but glowing faintly under the desert moonlight, the map was etched with unfamiliar symbols and marked with a path leading deep into the forgotten corners of Jabal Shams. Elders spoke in hushed tones of the “Ghābat al-Hamasa” — the Whispering Woods — a cursed grove no one dared enter. But now, the winds had shifted, and Saif was being called.
Saif sat cross-legged beneath the dim lantern glow, carefully unrolling the brittle map on the majlis floor. The parchment crackled like dry palm fronds, revealing a twisting trail marked in red ochre ink, leading beyond the familiar wadis and into the forbidden Ghābat al-Hamasa. Strange symbols circled certain landmarks—an old falaj, a cave shaped like a crescent moon, and a tree drawn with eyes in its bark. As his fingers traced the winding path, the room seemed to hush, as though the air itself held its breath. He felt the map pulsing faintly beneath his fingertips, as if it recognized him.

The next morning, before the village stirred, Saif packed dates, water, and his grandfather’s curved dagger wrapped in cloth. He paused at the edge of the terraced fields, staring out at the dark silhouette of the woods crouched against the rising sun. His heart pounded with the thrill of discovery, but also with a weight he couldn’t name. “Whatever secrets you hold,” he whispered to the trees in the distance, “I will find them.” And with that, Saif stepped beyond the familiar stone paths, guided by the ancient map—and by the whispers that had begun to echo in his dreams.

As Saif stepped beneath the twisted acacia branches of the Whispering Woods, the air turned thick with the scent of myrrh and damp earth. The wind hummed like distant chanting, and every rustle felt like a watching eye. His heart pounded—half fear, half wonder—as ancient silence swallowed the world behind him.
