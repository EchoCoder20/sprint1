Deep within the Whispering Woods, Saif reached the final mark on the map—a circle of ancient stones humming with forgotten power. As he stepped into the center, the forest seemed to exhale, and the world folded into silence. The map crumbled in his hands, turning to dust beneath a silver wind. Days turned to weeks, and Saif never returned. Shadow was found at the forest’s edge, howling at the mountains, eyes fixed on the trees. Villagers searched every path, called his name across the wadis, but the woods kept their secret. To this day, some say the wind still whispers *Saif.*
